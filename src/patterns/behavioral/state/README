On State Pattern by GoF, each state is a class, but the class could not have any behavior.
Nowadays, this is done differently, and can be used for example with enums.

states and events/triggers
define:
 - state entry/exit behaviors
 - guard conditions enabling/disabling a transition
 - action when no transition are found for an event
 - action when a particular event causes a transition
